## Log files
Log files are files that records events that occours in a system and which user performed the action. This includes events such as transactions, errors, intrusions, login and logout. Log files are important to reconstruct an event after it occours. They should be saved to a different partition or an external server and should be archived and backed up to ensure they are available when required.
### System logs

### Application logs
Is a log that contains records of events for the operating system and third-party applications.
### Security logs
Is a log that contains records of login/logout activity or other security-related events specified by the system's audit policy, such as policy changes, privilege use and account management.

## Syslog/rsyslog/syslog-ng
Syslog is a standard for message logging. It allows the separation of the software that generates messages, the system that stores them and the software that reports and analyzes them. It is a protocol enabling different appliances and software applications to transmit logs or event records to a central server. Syslog follows a client-server model and is the standard for logging of events from distributed systems. It runs on most operating systems and network equipament using port 514 (UDP) over TCP/IP. Newer implementations can use á¹•ort 1468 (TCP) for consistent delivery, TLS to encrypt messages sent to servers, MD-5 or SHA-1 for authentication and integrity, message filtering, automated log analysis, event response scripting and alternate message formats. The newer version of the server is called syslog-ng or rsyslog.
