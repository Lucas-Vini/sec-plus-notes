## Attack frameworks
### Cyber Kill Chain
#### Reconnaissance
Research, identification and selection of targets. Searching for weak points (search engines, web archives, public cloud services, domain name registries, WHOIS command, packet sniffers, network mapping, DIG command, ping, port scanners).
#### Weaponization
Creation of the malware to be executed in the target system that exploits the vulnerabilities discovered.
