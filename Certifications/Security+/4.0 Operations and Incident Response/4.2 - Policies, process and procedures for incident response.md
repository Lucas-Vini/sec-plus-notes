## Attack frameworks
### MITRE ATT&CK
Maintained by MITRE Corporation, MITRE ATT&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tatics, techniques and common knowledge based on real-world observations. It is used as a fundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in private sector, in government and in cybersecurity product and service community.

### The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis
A framework for analyzing cybersecurity incidents and intrusions by exploring the relationships between four core features:
#### Adversary
The persona of the individual or group attacking you.
#### Infrastructure
IP addresses, domain names or email addresses.
#### Capabilities
What the adversary can do (malware, exploit, manipulate infrastructure)
#### Victim
### Cyber Kill Chain
#### Reconnaissance
Research, identification and selection of targets. Searching for weak points (search engines, web archives, public cloud services, domain name registries, WHOIS command, packet sniffers, network mapping, DIG command, ping, port scanners, etc).
#### Weaponization
Development of the malware to be executed in the target system that exploits the vulnerabilities discovered.
#### Delivery
The attacker identifies a vector to transmit the weaponized code to the target. It can be done via phishing, compromised user account, USB drive, website, etc.
#### Exploitation
Once it has been delivered, the weaponized code is executed to exploit the target vulnerability.
#### Installation
The weaponized code install an remote access point (like a backdoor) useble by the attacker to achieve persistence on the target system. In other words, the attacker can move in anda move out of the target's system/network withou running the risk of detection by reentering through other attack vector.
#### Command and Control
The weaponized code connects to a remote server that can be used to run commands in the target system remotely.
#### Actions and objectives
With the "hands on keyboard" access, the attacker can accomplish his original goals, such as data exfiltration, data destruction, encryption for ransom, cause a denial of service or spy.

## Disaster Recovery Plan
Disaster Recovery involves a set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster.
