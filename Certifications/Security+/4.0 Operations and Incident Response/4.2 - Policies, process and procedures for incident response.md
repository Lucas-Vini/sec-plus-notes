## Attack frameworks
### Cyber Kill Chain
#### Reconnaissance
Research, identification and selection of targets. Searching for weak points (search engines, web archives, public cloud services, domain name registries, WHOIS command, packet sniffers, network mapping, DIG command, ping, port scanners, etc).
#### Weaponization
Development of the malware to be executed in the target system that exploits the vulnerabilities discovered.
#### Delivery
The attacker identifies a vector to transmit the weaponized code to the target. It can be done via phishing, compromised user account, USB drive, website, etc.
#### Exploitation
Once it has been delivered, the weaponized code is executed to exploit the target vulnerability.
#### Installation
The weaponized code install an remote access point (like a backdoor) useble by the attacker to achieve persistence on the target system. In other words, the attacker can move in anda move out of the target's system/network withou running the risk of detection by reentering through other attack vector.
