## Identity
### Identity provider (IdP)
An Identity provider (IdP) stores and manages users' digital identities. Think of an IdP as being like a guest list, but for digital and cloud-hosted applications instead of an event. An IdP may check user identity via username-password combinations and other factors, or it may simply provide a list of user identities that another service provider (like an SSO) checks. IdPs are not limited to verifying human users. Technically, an IdP can authenticate any entity connected to a network or a system, including computers and other devices. Any entity stored by an IdP is known as a "principal" (instead of a "user"). However, IdPs are most often used in cloud computing to manage user identities.
### Certificates
Identity certificate is an electronic document used to prove the validaty of a public key.
### SSH keys
SSH keys can serve as a means of identifying yourself to an SSH server using public key cryptography and challenge-response authentication.

## Account types
A service account is a special account that an application or service uses to interact with the operating system or another application or service. Applications and calls use the service accounts to log on and make changes to the operating system or the configuration, and perform these activities in the background. It is a good security practice to disable interactive login on service accounts. 

## Account policies
### password complexity
A password should be long, strong and complex. This should require at least 14 characters with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.
### Access policies
Access policies can be used to perform step-up and reauthentication during a single sign-on flow based on contextual information. It can be enforced at a federation or at API Protection for OAuth and OpenID Connect. For example, it can restrict single sign-on access to applications based on the user and group membership or based on devices, locations, and time.
### Account permissions
It consists of implementing the appropriate permissions to accounts folowing the principle of the least privilege and policies.
### Account audits
It is important to perform account audits periodically to verify if accounts permissions need to keep the same that was set initially.
