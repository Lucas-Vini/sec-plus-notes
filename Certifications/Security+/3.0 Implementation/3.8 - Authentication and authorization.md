## Authentication/Authorization
### EAP
A framework of protocols that allows for numerous methods of authentication including passwords, digital certificates and public key infrastructure.
### Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
Used to provide authentication but it is not considered secure since it transmits the login credentials unencrypted.
### Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
CHAP is an evolution of PAP. It is used to provide authentication by using the user's password to encrypt a challenge string of random numbers.
### 802.1x
It is a standardized framework used for port-based authentication on wired and wireless networks. It provides an authentication mechanism to devices wishing to attach to a LAN or WLAN.
### Single Sign-On (SSO)
Is a authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.
### Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
Is a open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. It is an attestation model built upon XML used to share federated identity management information between systems.
### OpenID
OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol promoted by the non-profit OpenID Fundation. It allows users to be authenticated by cooperating sites (known as relying parties) using a third-party identity provider service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc login systems and allowing users to log in to multiple unrelated websites without having to have a separate identity and password for each.

### Kerberos
Is a computer-network authentication protocol that provides two-way (mutual) authentication that works on the basis of tickets. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. It runs over port 88.
