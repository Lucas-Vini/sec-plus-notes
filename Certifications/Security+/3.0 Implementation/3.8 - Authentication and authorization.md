## Authentication/Authorization
### Single Sign-On (SSO)
Is a authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.
### Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
Is a open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular, between an identity provider and a service provider. It is an attestation model built upon XML used to share federated identity management information between systems.
### OpenID
OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol promoted by the non-profit OpenID Fundation. It allows users to be authenticated by cooperating sites (known as relying parties) using a third-party identity provider service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc login systems and allowing users to log in to multiple unrelated websites without having to have a separate identity and password for each.
