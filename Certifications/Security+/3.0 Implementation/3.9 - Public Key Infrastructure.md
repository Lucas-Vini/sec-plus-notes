## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
PKI is a set of policies, processes, server platforms, software and workstations used for the purpose of administering certificates and public-private key pairs, including the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates. 
### Key management
Key management refers to management of cryptographic keys in a cryptosystem. This includes dealing with the generation, exchange, storage, use, crypto-shredding and replacement of keys. It includes cryptographic protocol design, key servers, user procedures and other relevant protocols.
### Certificate Authority (CA)
A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted organization that issues digital certificates for websites and other entities. CAs validate a website domain and, depending on the type of certificate, the ownership of the website, and then issue TLS/SSL certificates that are trusted by web browsers like Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
### Registration Authority (RA)
An entity authorized by the certification authority system (CAS) to collect, verify, and submit information provided by potential subscribers which is to be entered into public key certificates.
### Certificate revocation list (CRL)
A list of digital certificates that have been revoked by an issuing CA before their scheduled expiration date and should no longer be trusted.
### Certificate attributes
The Enterprise Gateway can authorize access to a Web Service based on the X.509 attributes of an authenticated client's certificate. For example, a simple Certificate Attributes filter might only authorize clients whose certificates have a Distinguished Name (DName) containing the following attribute: O=oracle. In other words, only "oracle" users are authorized to access the Web Service.
### Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
The OCSP is an alternative to the certificate revocation list (CRL) and is used to whether a digital certificate is valid or if it has been revoked.
### Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
SAN certificates can have multiple fully qualified domain names with a single certificate. 

## Types of certificate
### Wildcard
A wildcard certificate is a public key certificate which can be used with multiple sub-domains of a domain. The principal use is for securing web sites with HTTPS, but there are also applications in many other fields.
### Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
SAN certificates can have multiple fully qualified domain names with a single certificate. 
### Code signing
It is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. The process employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate authencity and integrity.

## Certificate formats
### Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
DER is a restricted variant of BER for producing unequivocal transfer syntax for data structures described by ASN.1.
### Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
PEM is a de facto file format for storing and sending cryptographic keys, certificates, and other data, based on a set of 1993 IETF standards defining "privacy-enhanced mail".
### Personal Information Exchange (PFX)
PFX file is a single, password protected or password-less certificate archive which contains the certificate chain and the private key defined by PKCS #12.
### .cer
A file with an extension .cer is responsible for storing some information about the owner certificate and the specific public key. This format of file cannot store the private keys and have the capacity of store only one certificate which is x509.
### P12
PKCS #12 (.p12 file extension) defines an archive file format for storing many cryptographic objects as a single file. It is commonly used to bundle a private key with its X.509 certificate or to bundle all the members of a chain of trust.
### P7B
The P7B file contains the certificate and its chain (intermediate certificates) but does not contain the private key.

## Concepts
### Certificate chaining
When you receive a certificate for another entity, you might need to use a certificate chain to obtain th root CA certificate. The certificate chain, also known as certification path, is a list of certificates used to authenticate an entity. The chain, or path, begins with the certificate of that entity, and each certificate in the chain is signed by the entity identified by the next certificate in the chain. The chain terminates with a root CA certificate. The root CA certificate is always signed by the certificate authority (CA) itself. The signatures of all certificates is the chain must be verified until the root CA certificate is reached.
