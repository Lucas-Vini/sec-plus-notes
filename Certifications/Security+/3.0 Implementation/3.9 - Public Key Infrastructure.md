## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
PKI is a set of policies, processes, server platforms, software and workstations used for the purpose of administering certificates and public-private key pairs, including the ability to issue, maintain, and revoke public key certificates. 
### Key management
Key management refers to management of cryptographic keys in a cryptosystem. This includes dealing with the generation, exchange, storage, use, crypto-shredding and replacement of keys. It includes cryptographic protocol design, key servers, user procedures and other relevant protocols.
### Certificate Authority (CA)
A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted organization that issues digital certificates for websites and other entities. CAs validate a website domain and, depending on the type of certificate, the ownership of the website, and then issue TLS/SSL certificates that are trusted by web browsers like Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
### Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
SAN certificates can have multiple fully qualified domain names with a single certificate. 

## Types of certificate
### Wildcard
A wildcard certificate is a public key certificate which can be used with multiple sub-domains of a domain. The principal use is for securing web sites with HTTPS, but there are also applications in many other fields.
### Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
SAN certificates can have multiple fully qualified domain names with a single certificate. 
### Code signing
It is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. The process employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate authencity and integrity.

## Concepts
### Certificate chaining
When you receive a certificate for another entity, you might need to use a certificate chain to obtain th root CA certificate. The certificate chain, also known as certification path, is a list of certificates used to authenticate an entity. The chain, or path, begins with the certificate of that entity, and each certificate in the chain is signed by the entity identified by the next certificate in the chain. The chain terminates with a root CA certificate. The root CA certificate is always signed by the certificate authority (CA) itself. The signatures of all certificates is the chain must be verified until the root CA certificate is reached.
