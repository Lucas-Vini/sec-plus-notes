## Load balancing
Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool. Modern high-traffic websites must serve millions of concurrent request from users and return the correct response in a fast and reliable manner. A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance. If a single server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers. When a new server is added to the server group, the load balancer automatically starts to send requests to it.
### Persintence
Information about a user’s session is often stored locally in the browser. For example, in a shopping cart application the items in a user’s cart might be stored at the browser level until the user is ready to purchase them. Changing which server receives requests from that client in the middle of the shopping session can cause performance issues or outright transaction failure. In such cases, it is essential that all requests from a client are sent to the same server for the duration of the session. This is known as session persistence. Another use case for session persistence is when an upstream server stores information requested by a user in its cache to boost performance. Switching servers would cause that information to be fetched for the second time, creating performance inefficiencies.

## Network segmentation
Network segmentation is an architectural approach that divides a network into multiple segments or subnets, each acting as its own small network. This allows network administrators to control the flow of traffic between subnets based on granular policies. Organizations use segmentation to improve monitoring, boost performance, localize technical issues and - most importantly - enhance security.
### Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
A VLAN is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer. In this context, virtual, refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic, within the local area network.
### Screened subnet (previously known as demilitarized zone)
A perimeter network or screened subnet separating an internal network that is more trusted from an external network that is less trusted.
### Extranet
A computer network that an organization uses for application data traffic between the organization and its business partners.
### Intranet
A computer network, especially one based on Internet technology, that an organization uses for its own internal (and usually private) purposes and that is closed to outsider.
### Zero-trust
A zero-trust security is defined by the idea that no one is blindly trust and allowed to access company assets until they have been validated as legitimate and authorized. It operates on the principle of "least privelege access", which selectively grants permissions to only the resources that users or groups of users require, nothing more. Additionally, those who are granted access to the network, data, and other assets are continuously required to authenticate their identity.

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
A VPN extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. It allows end user to create a tunnel over a untrusted network and connect remotely and securely back into the enterprise network.

### Always-on
User don't need to start and stop connections because the client computers are always connected to the network.

### Split tunnel vs full tunnel
Full tunnel means using your VPN for all your traffic, whereas split tunnel means sending part of your traffic through a VPN and part of it through the open network.

### Remote access vs site-to-site
Whereas remote access VPNs securely connect individual devices to a remote LAN, site-to-site VPNs securely connect two or more LANs in different physical locations.

### IPSec
IPsec is a group of protocols that are used together to set up encrypted connections between devices. It helps keep data sent over public networks secure. IPsec is often used to set up VPNs, and it works by encrypting IP packets, along with authentication the source where the packets come from. Security for OSI Layer 3 (network), commonly used in a site-to-site communication.

### SSL/TLS
Both were designed to provide privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. They was designed to encapsulate other protocols, such as HTTP. But SSL is an older and vulnerable and should not be used. Currently, TLS is widely implemented in browsers and web servers and is the secure option.

### Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
L2TP is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks or as part of the delivery of services by ISPs. It uses encryption only for its own control messages and does not provide any encryption or confidentiality of content by itself.

## DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages.

## Network Access Control (NAC)
Network access control is the act of keeping unauthorized users and devices out of a private network. Organizations that give certain devices or users from outside of the organization occasional access to the network can use network access control to ensure that these devices meet corporate security compliance regulations.
### Agent vs agentless
Agent NAC requires agent software to report end-system characteristics. Agentless NAC use scanning and network inventory techniques to discern those characteristics remotely.

## Port security
Port security enables you to configure each switch port with a unique list of MAC addresses of devices that are authorized to access the network through that port.
### Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) guard
In an STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) environment, switches, end stations, and other Layer 2 devices use Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to exchange information that STP will use to determine the best path for data flow. The BPDU guard, an enhancement to STP, removes a node that reflects BPDUs back in the network. It enforces the STP domain borders and keeps the active topology predictable by not allowing any network devices behind a BPDU guard-enabled port to participate in STP. It is also knows as root guard.
### Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping
DHCP snooping is a series of techniques applied to improve the security of a DHCP infrastructure. DHCP servers allocate IP adresses to clients on a LAN. DHCP snooping can be configured on LAN switches to exclude rogue DHCP servers and remove malicious or malformed DHCP traffic. 
### Media Access Control (MAC) filtering
MAC filtering refers to a security access control method whereby the MAC address assigned to each network card is used to determine access to the network. MAC addresses are uniquely assigned to each card, so using MAC filtering on a network permits and denies network access to specific devices through the use of blacklists and whitelists.

## Network appliances

### Jump servers
A jump server, jump host or jump box is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. A jump server is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them.

### Proxy servers
It is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource. This serves as a method to simplify or control the complexity of the resquest or additional benefits such as load balancing, privacy or security.
#### Foward
A foward proxy is the most common form of a proxy server and is generally used to pass requests from an isolated, private network to the Internet through a firewall. A foward proxy server will first check to make sure request is valid. If a request is not valid, or not allowed, it will reject the request resulting in the client receiving an error or redirect. If a request is valid, a forward proxy may check if the requested information is cached. If it is, the forward proxy serves the cached information. If it is not, the request is sent through a firewall to an actual content server which serves the information to the forward proxy. The proxy, in turn, relays this information to the client and may also cache it, for future requests. 


### Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
A Network-based Intrusion Detection System is a piece of hardware installed in a network to monitor and analyzing all the traffic passing through the switch in order to identify an incident or attack. The NIDS will get a copy of all data and log and alert everything that look suspicius using one of the following methods: signature-based (a specific string of bytes triggers an alert), policy (relies on specific declaration of the security police, for example, "No telnet allowed") or anomaly detection (triggers an alert if the current traffic is outside of the statistical average).

### Network-based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)
A Network-based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) is a type of network security software that detects malicious activity on a network, report information about said activity and takes steps to block or stop the activity from occouring automatically. This is an expansion of capabilities over an "intrusion detection system".

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
A physical computing device that safeguards and manages cryptographic keys and provides cryptographic processing. An HSM is or contains a cryptographic module.

### Sensors
Intrusion detection and prevention system components that monitor and analyze network activity and may also perform prevention actions.

### Firewalls
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall tipically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.
#### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
A WAF or Web Application Firewall helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It tipically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, SQL injection, among others.
#### Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
A Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) is a network security device that provides capabilities beyonnd a traditional, stateful firewall. While a traditional firewall tipically provides stateful inspection of incoming and outgoing network traffic, a NGFW includes additional features like application awareness and control, integrated intrusion prevension and cloud-delivered threat intelligence.

#### Stateful
A stateful firewall inspects everything inside data packets, the characteristics of the data and its channels of communication. Stateful firewall examine the behavior of data packets and if anything seems off, they can filter out the suspicious data (even if that kind of behavior has not been manually set inputted by an administrator).
#### Stateless
Stateless firewalls make use of data packet's source, destination and other parameters to figure out whether the data presents a threat (IP address and port number). These parameters have to be entered by either an administrator or the manufacturer via rules they set beforehand.
#### Unified Threat Management (UTM)
Unified Threat Management (UTM) is an approach to information security where a single hardware or software installation provides multiple security functions, such as firewall, DLP, anti-malware, NIPS, content filtering and VPN.
#### Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway
NAT is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit acrros a traffic routing device.
#### Content/URL filter
A content/URL filter will restrict or control the content an internet user is capable to access. If a content is not allowed, it will block the external files containing JavaScript, images or web pages from loading in the browser. Usually it is used to block inappropriate content, like pornograph or games.
#### Open-source vs. proprietary
Open source refers to technology and software that is available for anyone to use or edit. Proprietary is copyrighted technology that must be used with a license.
#### Hardware vs. Software
Software-based firewalls runs as a piece of software on a host or a server. Hardware-based firewalls are standalone devices that's actually an appliance that's installed into your network. It looks like another switch or another router that goes into your network stack.
#### Appliance vs. host-based vs. virtual
##### Appliance
A device that provides firewall protection for a network. It includes all the necessary hardware and software in a self-contained package that plugs in between the two networks being isolated. Most firewall appliances are solid state and include a stripped down operating system.

## Access Control List (ACL)
Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a collection of permit and deny conditions, called rules, that provide security by blocking unauthorized users and allowing authorized users to access specific resources. ACLs can also provide traffic flow control, restrict contents of routing updates, and decide which types of traffic are forwarded or blocked. Normally ACLs reside in a firewall router or in a router connecting two internal networks.

## Quality of Service (QoS)
It is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer network or a cloud computing service, particularly the performance seen by the user of the network.

## Port spanning/Port mirroring
Port mirroring is used on a network switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one switch port to a networking monitoring connection on another switch port.

### Network tap
A network tap is typically a dedicated hardware device that intercepts all data flowing between two points on the network. It copies all data passing through to its monitor port, enabling a third party to listen.
