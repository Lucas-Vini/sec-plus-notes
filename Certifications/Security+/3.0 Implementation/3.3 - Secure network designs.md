### Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
A Network-based Intrusion Detection System is a piece of hardware installed in a network to monitor and analyzing all the traffic passing through the switch in order to identify an incident or attack. The NIDS will get a copy of all data and log and alert everything that look suspicius using one of the following methods: signature-based (a specific string of bytes triggers an alert), policy (relies on specific declaration of the security police, for example, "No telnet allowed") or anomaly detection (triggers an alert if the current traffic is outside of the statistical average).
