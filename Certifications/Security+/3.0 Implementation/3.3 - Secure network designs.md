## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
A VPN extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. It allows end user to create a tunnel over a untrusted network and connect remotely and securely back into the enterprise network.

### Always-on
User don't need to start and stop connections because the client computers are always connected to the network.

### Split tunnel vs full tunnel
Full tunnel means using your VPN for all your traffic, whereas split tunnel means sending part of your traffic through a VPN and part of it through the open network.

### Remote access vs site-to-site
Whereas remote access VPNs securely connect individual devices to a remote LAN, site-to-site VPNs securely connect two or more LANs in different physical locations.

### IPSec
Security for OSI Layer 3 (network). Commonly used in a site-to-site communication.

### Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
L2TP is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks or as part of the delivery of services by ISPs. It uses encryption only for its own control messages and does not provide any encryption or confidentiality of content by itself.

## Network appliances

### Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
A Network-based Intrusion Detection System is a piece of hardware installed in a network to monitor and analyzing all the traffic passing through the switch in order to identify an incident or attack. The NIDS will get a copy of all data and log and alert everything that look suspicius using one of the following methods: signature-based (a specific string of bytes triggers an alert), policy (relies on specific declaration of the security police, for example, "No telnet allowed") or anomaly detection (triggers an alert if the current traffic is outside of the statistical average).

### Firewalls
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall tipically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.
#### Stateful
A stateful firewall inspects everything inside data packets, the characteristics of the data and its channels of communication. Stateful firewall examine the behavior of data packets and if anything seems off, they can filter out the suspicious data (even if that kind of behavior has not been manually set inputted by an administrator).
#### Stateless
Stateless firewalls make use of data packet's source, destination and other parameters to figure out whether the data presents a threat (IP address and port number). These parameters have to be entered by either an administrator or the manufacturer via rules they set beforehand.
#### Content/URL filter
A content/URL filter will restrict or control the content an internet user is capable to access. If a content is not allowed, it will block the external files containing JavaScript, images or web pages from loading in the browser. Usually it is used to block inappropriate content, like pornograph or games.
#### Hardware vs. Software
Software-based firewalls runs as a piece of software on a host or a server. Hardware-based firewalls are standalone devices that's actually an appliance that's installed into your network. It looks like another switch or another router that goes into your network stack.

## Port spanning/Port mirroring
Port mirroring is used on a network switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one switch port to a networking monitoring connection on another switch port.

### Network tap
A network tap is typically a dedicated hardware device that intercepts all data flowing between two points on the network. It copies all data passing through to its monitor port, enabling a third party to listen.
