### Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
A Network-based Intrusion Detection System is a piece of hardware installed in a network to monitor and analyzing all the traffic passing through the switch in order to identify an incident or attack. The NIDS will get a copy of all data and log and alert everything that look suspicius using one of the following methods: signature-based (a specific string of bytes triggers an alert), policy (relies on specific declaration of the security police, for example, "No telnet allowed") or anomaly detection (triggers an alert if the current traffic is outside of the statistical average).

### Firewalls
#### Content/URL filter
A content/URL filter will restrict or control the content an internet user is capable to access. If a content is not allowed, it will block the external files containing JavaScript, images or web pages from loading in the browser. Usually it is used to block inappropriate content, like pornograph or games.
