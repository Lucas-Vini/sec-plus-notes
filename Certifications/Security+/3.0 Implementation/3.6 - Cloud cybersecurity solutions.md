### Firewall considerations in a cloud environment
#### Open Systems Interconnections (OSI) Layers
The OSI model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate usind standard protocols. The OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other. Physical layer transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium. Datalink layer defines the format of data on the network. Network layer decides which physical path the data will take. Transport Layer transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP. Session layer maintains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions. Presentation layer ensures that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs. Application layer is the human-computer interaction layer, where applications can access the network services.
