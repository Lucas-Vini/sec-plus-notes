## Cryptographic protocols
### WiFi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)
WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2) is the second generation of the WiFi Protected Access wireless security protocol. It was designed to secure and protect WiFi networks by ensuring that data sent and received over the wireless network is encrypted with Advanced Encryption System (AES) and only people with your network password have access to it.
### WiFi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)
WPA3 was introduced to strengthen WPA2. The largest improvement in WPA3 is the removal of the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) exchange. Instead, it uses Simutaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE).
### Simutaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
Simutaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) is a secure password-based authentication and password-authenticated key agreement method, providing foward secrecy.

## Methods
### Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
It is a automated encryption setup for wireless network at a push of a button, but it is severely flawed adn vulnerable.
