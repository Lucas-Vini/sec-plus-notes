WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access 2) is the second generation of the WiFi Protected Access wireless security protocol. It was designed to secure and protect WiFi networks by ensuring that data sent and received over the wireless network is encrypted with Advanced Encryption System (AES) and only people with your network password have access to it.
