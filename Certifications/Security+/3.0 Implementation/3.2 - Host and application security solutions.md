## Endpoint protection

### Antivirus and Antimalware
An antivirus is a software designed to prevent, detect, scan and remove malware from a computer. Similarly, an antimalware also prevent, detect, scan and remove malware from a computer, but an antimalware is more focused in defends against more modern malwares. It protects the user from the latest, currently in the wild and even more dangerous threats.

### Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)
A Host-based Intrusion Detection System is a software application installed in a computer or server to monitor and analyzing the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces in order to identify an incident or attack. The HIDS will log and alert everything that look suspicius using one of the following methods: signature-based (a specific string of bytes triggers an alert), policy (relies on specific declaration of the security police, for example, "No telnet allowed") or anomaly detection (triggers an alert if the current traffic is outside of the statistical average).

### Host-based firewall
A host-based firewall is a firewall software that runs on an individual computer or device connected to a network. A host-based firewall protects you from viruses and malwares and controls the spread of these harmful infections throughout the network. Furthermore, host-based firewall protects you from untrusted devices that are on the same network. It works by applying a set of rules and policies against traffic that's attempting to come into or go out of our protected computer.
