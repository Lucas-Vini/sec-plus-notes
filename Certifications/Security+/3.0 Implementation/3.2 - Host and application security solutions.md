## Endpoint protection

### Antivirus and Antimalware
An antivirus is a software designed to prevent, detect, scan and remove malware from a computer. Similarly, an antimalware also prevent, detect, scan and remove malware from a computer, but an antimalware is more focused in defends against more modern malwares. It protects the user from the latest, currently in the wild and even more dangerous threats.

### Endpoint DLP
An endpoint Data Loss Prevention system is a type of software designed to monitors the data in use on a computer and can stop file transfer or alert an admin of the occurrence. It can be set to detection mode or prevention mode.

### Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)
A Host-based Intrusion Prevention System is a software application installed in a computer or server to monitor and analyzing the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces in order to identify and block an incident or attack. The HIPS will log, alert and block everything that look suspicius using one of the following methods: signature-based (a specific string of bytes triggers an alert), policy (relies on specific declaration of the security police, for example, "No telnet allowed") or anomaly detection (triggers an alert if the current traffic is outside of the statistical average). HIPS can alert, log and also block suspicious activity.

### Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)
A Host-based Intrusion Detection System is a software application installed in a computer or server to monitor and analyzing the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces in order to identify an incident or attack. The HIDS will log and alert everything that look suspicius using one of the following methods: signature-based (a specific string of bytes triggers an alert), policy (relies on specific declaration of the security police, for example, "No telnet allowed") or anomaly detection (triggers an alert if the current traffic is outside of the statistical average). HIDS can only alert and log suspicious activity.

### Host-based firewall
A host-based firewall is a firewall software that runs on an individual computer or device connected to a network. A host-based firewall protects you from viruses and malwares and controls the spread of these harmful infections throughout the network. Furthermore, host-based firewall protects you from untrusted devices that are on the same network. It works by applying a set of rules and policies against traffic that's attempting to come into or go out of our protected computer.

## Boot integrity
### Secure boot
Secure boot is a security stadard developd by members of the PC industry to help make sure that a device boots using only software that is trusted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). When the PC starts, the firmware checks the signature of each piece of boot software. If the signatures are valid, the PC boots and the firmware gives control to the operating system. When enabled and fully configured, secure boot helps the computer resist attacks and infections from malware.

## Self-Encrypting Drive (SED)/Full-Disk Encryption (FDE)
### OPAL
Self-Encrypting Drive is a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD) designed to automatically encrypt and decrypt drive data without the need for user input or disk encryption software. OPAL is a set of specifications for self-encrypting drives developed by the Trusted Computing Group.

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
Trusted Platform Module is a computer chip designed to provide hardware-based, security-related function and can store passwords, certificates or encryption keys.
