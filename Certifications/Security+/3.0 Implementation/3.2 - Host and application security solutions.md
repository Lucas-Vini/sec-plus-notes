### Antivirus and Antimalware
An antivirus is a software designed to prevent, detect, scan and remove malware from a computer. Similarly, an antimalware also prevent, detect, scan and remove malware from a computer, but an antimalware is more focused in defends against more modern malwares. It protects the user from the latest, currently in the wild and even more dangerous threats.

### Host-based firewall
A host-based firewall is a firewall software that runs on an individual computer or device connected to a network. A host-based firewall protects you from viruses and malwares and controls the spread of these harmful infections throughout the network. Furthermore, host-based firewall protects you from untrusted devices that are on the same network. It works by applying a set of rules and policies against traffic that's attempting to come into or go out of our protected computer.
