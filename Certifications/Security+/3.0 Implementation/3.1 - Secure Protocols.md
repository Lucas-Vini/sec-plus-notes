## Protocols
### Domain Name System
The Domain Name System is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers reachalbe through the Internet or other Internet Protocol networks. The resource records contained in the DNS associate domain names with other forms of information. it works over the port 53 using UDP.
### Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
A set of specifications for securing electronic mail. S/MIME is based upon the widely used MIME standard and describes a protocol for adding cryptographic security services through MIME encapsulation of digitally signed and encrypted objects. The basic security services offered by S/MIME are authentication, non-repudiation of origin, message integrity, and message privacy. Optional security services include signed receipts, security labels, securing mailing lists, and an extended method of identifying the signer's certificate(s). 
### SSH
The Secure Shell Protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable applications are remote login and command-line execution. SSH applications are based on a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server. It works over the port 22 using either TCP or UDP.
### Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Over SSL (LDAPS)
Is a open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over internet protocol network. LDAP communicates unencrypted over the port 389 and encrypted (LDAPS) over the port 636.
### File Tranfer Protocol Secure (FTPS)
FTPS is an extension to the commonly used File Transfer Protocol (used to transfer files from host to host) that adds support to Transport Layer Security (TLS) and, formerly, the Secure Sockets Layer Cryptographic protocols. It works over the ports 989 and 990 using a TCP connection.
### SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)
SSH File Transfer Protocol is a network protocol that provides file access, file transfer and file management over any reliable data stream. It was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force as an extension of the Secure Shell protocol version 2.0 to provide secure file transfer capabilities. It works over the port 22 using either TCP or UDP.
### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
Simple Network Management Protocol is an internet standard protocol for collecting, organizing and monitoring information about managed devices. SNMP v1 and v2 are insecure due to the use of community strings to access a device. SNMP v3 provides integrity, authentication and encryption of the messages being sent over the network.
### Hypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used for secure communication over a computer network and is widely used on the internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer.
### IPSec
IPsec is a group of protocols that are used together to set up encrypted connections between devices. It helps keep data sent over public networks secure. IPsec is often used to set up VPNs, and it works by encrypting IP packets, along with authentication the source where the packets come from. Security for OSI Layer 3 (network), commonly used in a site-to-site communication.
#### Authentication Header/Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP)
##### Authentication Header
The Authentication Header (AH) protocol provides data origin authentication, data integrity, and replay protection. However, AH does not provide data confidentiality, which means that all of your data is sent in the clear.
##### Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP)
The Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP) protocol provides confidentiality, and also optionally provides data origin authentication, data integrity checking, and replay protection. The difference between ESP and the Authentication Header (AH) protocol is that ESP provides encryption, while both protocols provide authentication, integrity checking, and replay protection.
### Post Office Protocol (POP)/Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
#### POP3
Post Office Protocol is an application layer Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email from a server. POP version 3 is the version in common use and along with IMAP the most common protocols for email retrieval.
#### IMAP
The Internet Message Access Protocol ia an internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection.
