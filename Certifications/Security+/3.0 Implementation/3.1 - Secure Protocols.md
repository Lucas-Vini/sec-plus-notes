## Protocols

### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
Simple Network Management Protocol is an internet standard protocol for collecting, organizing and monitoring information about managed devices. SNMP v1 and v2 are insecure due to the use of community strings to access a device. SNMP v3 provides integrity, authentication and encryption of the messages being sent over the network.
