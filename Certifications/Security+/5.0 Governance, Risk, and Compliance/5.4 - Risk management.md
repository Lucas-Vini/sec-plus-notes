## Risk management strategies
### Aceptance
A strategy that seeks to accept the current level of risk and the cost associated with it if the risk were realized.
### Avoidance
A strategy that requires stopping the activity that has risk or choosing a less risky alternative.
### Transference
A strategy that passes the risk to a third party.
### Mitigation
A strategy that seeks to minimize the risk to an acceptable level.

## Risk analysis
### Residual risk
It is the amount of risk associated with an action or event remaining after natural or inherent risks have been reduced by risk controls.
### Risk assessment types
#### Qualitative
Qualitative risk analysis is the process of rating or scoring risk based on a person's perception of the severity and likelihood of its consequences.
#### Quantitative
Quantitative risk analysis is the process of calculating risk based on data gathered.


## Business impact analysis
Bussines impact analysis is a systematic process that identifies organizational risk and determines the potencial effects of an interruption to critical business operations as a result of a disaster, accident or emergency.
### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
RTO is the duration of time within which a bussines process or operation must be restored after a disaster in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in continuity.
### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
RPO is defined as the maximum amount of data (measured by the time between the last backup and the potencial disaster) that a organization can tolerate to be lost.
### Mean time to repair (MTTR)
Is the avarage time it takes to repair a sytem.
### Mean time between failures (MTBF)
Measures the avarage time between failures of system.
### Functional recovery plans
Functional recovery plan involves a set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery of a specific technical and business function. 
### Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Disaster Recovery involves a set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster. It has a broader perspective and might include multiple functional recovery plans.
### Single point of failure
It is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. It is undesireable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability.
