## Penetration testing
A penetration test, or pen test, is an attempt to evaluate the security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying to exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities may exist in operating system, services and applications flaws, improper configurations or risky end-user behavior.
### Known environment
Also known as white box testing, it is a test methodology that assumes explicit and substantial knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object.
### Unknown environment
Also known as black box testing, it is a test methodology that assumes no knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object.
### Partially Known environment
Also known as gray box testing, it is a test methodology that assumes some knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object.
### Rules of engagement
Detailed guidelines and constraints regarding the execution of information security testing. The ROE is established before the start of a security test, and gives the test team authority to conduct defined activities without the need for additional permissions.
### Lateral movement
Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target and subsequently gaining access to it. Reaching their objective often involves pivoting through multiple systems and accounts to gain. Adversaries might install their own remote access tools to accomplish Lateral Movement or use legitimate credentials with native network and operating system tools, which may be stealthier. 
### Privilege escalation
Occurs when an attacker is able to exploit a design flaw, a bug or a configuration oversight in a operating system or software application to gain illicit access of elavated rights or privileges, beyond what is intended or entitled for a user. Usually the goal is to gain administration or root levels privileges to perform unauthorized action. It can be a vertical escalation (going up to a administraion account) or horizontal escalation (lateral movement to a another user account).
### Persistence
Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Techniques used for persistence include any access, action or configurations changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or adding startup code.
### Cleanup
Once the penetration testing recommendations are complete, the tester should clean up the environment, reconfigure any access he/she obtained to penetrate the environment, and prevent future unauthorized access into the system through whatever means necessary.
### Bug bounty
Bug bounty programs offer monetary rewards to ethical hackers for successfully discovering and reporting a vulnerability or bug to the application's developer. Bug bounty programs allow companies to leverage the hacker community to improve their systems’ security posture over time.
### Pivoting
The act of an attacker moving from one compromised system to one or more other systems within the same or other organization. Pivoting is fundamental to the success of advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks.

## Passive and active reconnaissance
### Drones
An unmanned surveillance and reconnaissance aerial vehicle, is an unarmed military UAV that is used for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance.
### War flying
War flying is when someone on a plane, drone, or helicopter uses a WiFi enabled device to look for open access points.
### War driving
Also called access point mapping, is the act of locating and possibly exploiting connections to wireless local area networks while driving around a city or elsewhere.
### Footprinting
Footprinting is the technique used for gathering information about computer systems and the entities they belong to. Footprinting generally refers to one of the pre-attack phases. A hacker might use various tools and technologies to perform this action, such as Sam Spade, nslookup, traceroute, nmap and neotrace.

## Exercises types
### Red-team
A red team is a group that plays the role of an enemy to provide security feedback from that perspective. Red teams are used in many fields, especially in cybersecurity.
### Blue-team
A blue team is a group that perform an analysis of information systems to ensure security, identify security flaws, verify the effectiveness of each security measure, and to make certain all security measures will continue to be effective after implementation.
### White-team
The group responsible for refereeing an engagemente between a red team of mock attacker and a blue team of actual defenders of their enterprise's use of information systems. In a exercise, the white team acts as judges, enforces the rules of the exercise, observes the exercise, scores teams, resolves any problems that may arise, handles all requests for information or questions, and ensures that the competition runs fairly and does not cause operational problems for the defender's mission. The white team helps to establish the rules of engagement, the metrics for assessing results and the procedures for providing operational security for the engagement. The white team normally has responsability for deriving lessons-learned, conducting the post engagement, and promulgating results.
### Purple-team
Purple teaming is an amalgamation of the blue and red teams into a single team to provide value to the business. With a successful purple team, two groups of people normally working on opposite ends of the table are collaborating on a unified goal—improving cybersecurity together. It can remove a lot of competitiveness from security testing processes. Purple teams can replace red and blue teams, and they’re more cost-effective for smaller organizations. If you’re a big conglomerate, you might want to consider having a blue team, a red team, and a purple team. Purple teams work on both improving knowledge of the attacks an organization faces and building better defenses to defeat them.
