## Threat hunting
Threat hunting is the process of proactively searching for threats that were not detected by normal security monitoring and techniques. Threat hunting is important because sophisticated threats (like APTs) can get past automated cybersecurity, so you can discover them soon and minimize the damage. This is done analysing data of the network and computer systems.

## Vulnerability scans
A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computers, networks or applications for known weaknesss. These scanners are used to discover the weaknesses of a given system.

## Syslog/Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

### Syslog
A protocol enabling different appliances and software applications to transmit logs or event records to a central server. Syslog follows a client-server model and is the standard for logging of events from distributed systems. It runs on most operating systems and network equipament using port 514 (UDP) over TCP/IP. Newer implementations can use á¹•ort 1468 (TCP) for consistent delivery, TLS to encrypt messages sent to servers, MD-5 or SHA-1 for authentication and integrity, message filtering, automated log analysis, event response scripting and alternate message formats. The newer version of the server is called syslog-ng or rsyslog.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
SIEM is a solution (commonly as a software) that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications. It is also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance or auditing purposes.

#### User behavior analysis
User behavior analysis/analytics (UBA), sometimes called user entity behavior analytics (UEBA), is a category of software that helps security teams identify and respond to insider threats that might otherwise be overlooked.
#### Log aggregation
Log aggregation refers to the process of collecting data from various sources, whether they're business systems or security devices (like firewalls), and storing this data in a central location for easy access and analysis by IT team.

## Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)
A class of security tools that facilitates threat and vulnerability management, security incident response and security operations automation. It allows companies to collect threat-related data from a range of sources and automate responses to the threat. It can scan security/threat data, Analyze it with machine learning, automate data enrichment and provision new resources.
