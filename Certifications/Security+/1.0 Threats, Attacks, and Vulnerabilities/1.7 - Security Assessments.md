## Threat hunting
Threat hunting is the process of proactively searching for threats that were not detected by normal security monitoring and techniques. Threat hunting is important because sophisticated threats (like APTs) can get past automated cybersecurity, so you can discover them soon and minimize the damage. This is done analysing data of the network and computer systems.
