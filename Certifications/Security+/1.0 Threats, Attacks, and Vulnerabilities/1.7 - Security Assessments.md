## Threat hunting
Threat hunting is the process of proactively searching for threats that were not detected by normal security monitoring and techniques. Threat hunting is important because sophisticated threats (like APTs) can get past automated cybersecurity, so you can discover them soon and minimize the damage. This is done analysing data of the network and computer systems.

## Syslog/Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
SIEM is a solution (commonly as a software) that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications. It is also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance or auditing purposes.
