## Threat hunting
Threat hunting is the process of proactively searching for threats that were not detected by normal security monitoring and techniques. Threat hunting is important because sophisticated threats (like APTs) can get past automated cybersecurity, so you can discover them soon and minimize the damage. This is done analysing data of the network and computer systems.

## Syslog/Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

### Syslog
A protocol enabling different appliances and software applications to transmit logs or event records to a central server. Syslog follows a client-server model and is the standard for logging of events from distributed systems. It runs on most operating systems and network equipament using port 514 (UDP) over TCP/IP. Newer implementations can use á¹•ort 1468 (TCP) for consistent delivery, TLS to encrypt messages sent to servers, MD-5 or SHA-1 for authentication and integrity, message filtering, automated log analysis, event response scripting and alternate message formats. The newer version of the server is called syslog-ng or rsyslog.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
SIEM is a solution (commonly as a software) that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications. It is also used to log security data and generate reports for compliance or auditing purposes.
