## Zero-day
A zero-day is a software vulnerability either unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation or known and without a patch to correct it. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or network.

## Weak configurations
### Open permissions
Applications and systems should not be too permissive on files, directories or functions, only the necessary, following the least privilege principle.
### Unsecure root accounts
Applications and systems should not run as root or as a local admin, unless it is necessary, following the least privilege principle.
### Default settings
Settings defined by the manufacturer during production. It can be dangerous things, like well known default accounts with administrator-level privileges.

## Impacts
