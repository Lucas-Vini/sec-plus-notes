## Social Engineering
Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into revealing confidential information or perform actions that may not be what they want. Some common social engineering techniques are listed below.

### Spam
Spam is the abuse of electronic messaging systems, most commonly through email, to send multiple unsolicited messages to large number of recipients for the purpose of comercial advertising, for the purpose of non-comercial proselytizing, for any prohibited purpose (especially the fraudulent purpose of phishing) or simply sending the same message over and over to the same user. Spammers often exploit a company's open mail relays to send their messages.

### Spam over instant messaging (SPIM)
SPIM is the abuse of instant messaging systems. It works just like spam, the only difference is the system used to send the messages. It will use things like text messages, social media chats or game chats.

### Hoax
A hoax is a message warning the recipients of non-existent computer virus threat. This might come as a email, a website pop-up window or a phone call. Normally it is part of something as somebody's game, somebody think it is a joke or someone trying to trick them out of money.
