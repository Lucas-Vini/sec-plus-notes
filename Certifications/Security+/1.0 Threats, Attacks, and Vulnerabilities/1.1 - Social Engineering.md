## Social Engineering
Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into revealing confidential information or perform actions that may not be what they want. Some common social engineering techniques are listed below.

### Phishing
Phishing is a type of social engineering in which a attacker sends a fraudulent message (masquerede as a trusted entity) to a user. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the revealing of sensitive data, installation of a malware or things like that.

### Spam
Spam is the abuse of electronic messaging systems, most commonly through email, to send multiple unsolicited messages to large number of recipients for the purpose of comercial advertising, for the purpose of non-comercial proselytizing, for any prohibited purpose (especially the fraudulent purpose of phishing) or simply sending the same message over and over to the same user. Spammers often exploit a company's open mail relays to send their messages.

### Spam over instant messaging (SPIM)
SPIM is the abuse of instant messaging systems. It works just like spam, the only difference is the system used to send the messages. It will use things like text messages, social media chats or game chats.

### Pharming
Pharming is a cyber attack intended to redirect a website's traffic to another, fake site by installing a malicious program on the computer. Pharming can be conducted either by changing the hosts file on a victim's computer or by exploitation of a vulnerability in DNS server software.

### Hoax
A hoax is a message warning the recipients of non-existent computer virus threat. This might come as a email, a website pop-up window or a phone call. Normally it is part of something as somebody's game, somebody think it is a joke or someone trying to trick them out of money.

### Watering hole attack
Is an attack in which the attacker guesses or observes the websites a organization often uses and infects one or more of them. The attacker knows that will be a lot of potential victims and, eventually, some member of the targeted group will become infected.

### Typosquatting
Is when an attacker register a common misspelling of another organization's domain as their own. It relies on typos mistakes by users when inputting a website address into the web browser. Tipically, it involves tricking users into visiting a malicious website and entering sensitive data into the fake site.
