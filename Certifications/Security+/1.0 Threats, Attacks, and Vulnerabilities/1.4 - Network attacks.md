## Wireless
### Evil twin
An evil twin is a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appear to be legitimate (usually with the same SSID or similar to the legitimate Wi-Fi), but is set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications. The evil twin is the wireless LAN equivalent of the phishing scam.
### Rogue Access Point
A rogue access point is a wireless access point (WAP) that has been installed on a secure network without explicit authorization from a local network administrator, whether added by a well-meaning employee or by malicious attacker.
### Bluesnarfing
Bluesnarfing is the unauthorized access of information from a wireless device through a bluetooth connection, often between phones, desktops and laptops.
### Bluejacking
Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over bluetooth to bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phone or laptop computers.
### Disassociation
Attack that targets an individual client connected to a wireless network, forces it offline by sending deauthentication packets to it and then captures the handshake that the client makes when it attempts to reconnect. It is used as part of an attack on WPA/WPA2.
### Jamming
Intentional radio frequency interference targeting a wireless network to cause a denial of service.
### Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
It uses electromagnetic fields in radio frequency to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. An RFID system consists of a tyny radio transponder, a radio receiver and transmitter.
### Near-Field Communication (NFC)
Is a set of communications protocols that enables communication between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm or less.
### Initialization Vector (IV)
The product (for example, WEP wireless protocol) uses a cryptographic primitive that uses an Initialization Vector (IV), but the product does not generate IVs that are sufficiently unpredictable or unique according to the expected cryptographic requirements for that primitive.

## On-path attack (previously known as man-in-the-middle attack/man-in-the-browser attack)
Occurs when an attacker is between the sender and the receiver communication and is able to intercept confidential data and manipulate the flow of informations. A common way used by attackers to intecept data is setting up trap Wi-Fi hotspots without password protection and with the same name of a trusted organization, so if someone connects to the attacker Wi-Fi all data will pass through the attackers' machine.

## Layer 2 attacks
### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning
ARP poisoning is an attack in which an attacker exploit the Address Resolution Protocol to disrupt, redirect or spy the traffic in a local area network.
### Media Access Control (MAC) flooding
A cyber attack aimed at compromising data transmitted to a device that is connected to a network switch. The method is based on overflowing the MAC address table for devices and their corresponding network segments. This database is necessary for more accurate routing of packets, allowing selective broadcasting to clients on the switch.
An attacker can send a large number of frames containing fake network identifiers to the switch, and flood the entire MAC address table with them. In this case, a legitimate clientâ€™s request is relayed to all segments of the network, and can be intercepted by an attacker.
### MAC cloning
Also known as MAC spoofing, it is a technique for changing factory-assigned Media Access Control address of a network interface on a network device. The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed.


## Domain Name System (DNS)
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
### Domain hijacking
Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant. Adversaries may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain.
### DNS poisoning
It is an attack in which a corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address, redirecting the traffic toward fake web servers and phishing websites.
### Uniform Resource Locator (URL) redirection
Unvalidated redirects and fowards are possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input. By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.
### Domain reputation
A domain reputation (also known as a sender reputation or an email reputation) is a score asigned to domains by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to evaluate the safety of a message before pushing it through the recipient. Domain reputation is one of the multiple factors ISPs and spam filters look at when considering whether an incoming email is secure.

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
A DDoS attack occours when multiple machines (ussually infected/compromised) are operating together to flood a network server with traffic, causing a denial of service (DoS).
### Network
In a network context, a DDoS is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
### Application
Application layer DDoS attacks are designed to attack the application itself, focusing on specific vulnerabilities or issues, resulting in the application not being able to deliver content to the user. Application layer DDoS attacks are designed to attack specific applications, the most common is web servers, but can include any application such SIP voice services and BGP.
### Operational technology
OT is the hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of industrial equipament, assets, processes and events. So a denial of service in this case would be the operational technologies stopping operation.

## Malicious code or script execution
Malicious code is the term used to describe any code in any part of a software system or script that is intended to cause undesired effects, security breaches or damage to a system. Malicious code is an application security threat that cannot be efficiently controlled by conventional antivirus software alone.
### PowerShell
Malicious PowerShell scripts are a key ingredient to many fileless malware. Windows PowerShell is a built-in tool based on the . NET framework comprising a command-line shell, an interface that lets users access services of the operating system (OS), and a programming language that can be used to create scripts.
### Python
Python is commonly used to create backdoors enabling the attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the infected machine.
### Bash
Bash is a Unix shell and command language and can be used by attacker to compromise a system.
### Macros
A virus that attaches itself to documents and uses the macro programming capabilities of the document's application to execute and propagate.
### Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is an implementation of Microsoft's Event-Driven Programming language Visual Basic 6.0 built into most desktop Microsoft Office applications and is very common an attacker use it in a malicious way to infect a system, also known as macros.
