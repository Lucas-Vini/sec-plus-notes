## On-path attack (previously known as man-in-the-middle attack/man-in-the-browser attack)
Occurs when an attacker is between the sender and the receiver communication and is able to intercept confidential data and manipulate the flow of informations. A common way used by attackers to intecept data is setting up trap Wi-Fi hotspots without password protection and with the same name of a trusted organization, so if someone connects to the attacker Wi-Fi all data will pass through the attackers' machine.
