## Wireless
### Evil twin
An evil twin is a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appear to be legitimate (usually with the same SSID or similar to the legitimate Wi-Fi), but is set up to eavesdrop on wireless communications. The evil twin is the wireless LAN equivalent of the phishing scam.
### Rogue Access Point
A rogue access point is a wireless access point (WAP) that has been installed on a secure network without explicit authorization from a local network administrator, whether added by a well-meaning employee or by malicious attacker.
### Bluesnarfing
Bluesnarfing is the unauthorized access of information from a wireless device through a bluetooth connection, often between phones, desktops and laptops.
### Bluejacking
Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over bluetooth to bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phone or laptop computers.
### Disassociation
Attack that targets an individual client connected to a wireless network, forces it offline by sending deauthentication packets to it and then captures the handshake that the client makes when it attempts to reconnect. It is used as part of an attack on WPA/WPA2.
### Jamming
Intentional radio frequency interference targeting a wireless network to cause a denial of service.
### Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
It uses electromagnetic fields in radio frequency to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. An RFID system consists of a tyny radio transponder, a radio receiver and transmitter.
### Near-Field Communication (NFC)
Is a set of communications protocols that enables communication between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm or less. 

## On-path attack (previously known as man-in-the-middle attack/man-in-the-browser attack)
Occurs when an attacker is between the sender and the receiver communication and is able to intercept confidential data and manipulate the flow of informations. A common way used by attackers to intecept data is setting up trap Wi-Fi hotspots without password protection and with the same name of a trusted organization, so if someone connects to the attacker Wi-Fi all data will pass through the attackers' machine.

## Domain Name System (DNS)
### DNS poisoning
It is an attack in which a corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address, redirecting the traffic toward fake web servers and phishing websites.

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
A DDoS attack occours when multiple machines (ussually infected/compromised) are operating together to flood a network server with traffic, causing a denial of service (DoS).
