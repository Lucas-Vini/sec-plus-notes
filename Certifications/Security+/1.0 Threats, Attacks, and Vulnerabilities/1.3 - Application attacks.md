## Privelege escalation
Occurs when an attacker is able to exploit a design flaw, a bug or a configuration oversight in a operating system or software application to gain illicit access of elavated rights or privileges, beyond what is intended or entitled for a user. Usually the goal is to gain administration or root levels privileges to perform unauthorized action.

## Directory traversal
Also known as path traversal attack, it aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with "../" sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.

## Buffer overflows
A buffer overflow conditions exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area past a buffer. In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an arrya of integers. Writing outside the bounds of a block allocated memory can corrupt data, crash the program or cause the execution of malicious code.
