Usually the goal is to gain administration or root levels privileges to perform unauthorized action.

## Directory traversal

By manipulating variables that reference files with "../" sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.
