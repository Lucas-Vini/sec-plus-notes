## Cloud models
### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
It is a type of cloud computing service that offers physical computing resources, storage, operating system and network resources on demand on a pay-as-you-go basis. It is used to develop your own software, web application or service.
### Platform as a service (Pass)
Like Iaas, PaaS includes infrastructure (servers, storage and networking), but also middleware, development tools (like a apache web server, programming language), business intelligence service, database management system (like a MySQL) and more. It allows you to avoid the expense and complexity of buying and manage software licenses, the underlying application infrastructure and middleware, container orchestration such as Kubernetes or the development tools and other resources. 
### Software as a service (SaaS)
Provides all  the hardware, operating system, software and applications needed for a complete service to be delivered. It is a way of delivering applications remotely over the internet instead of locally on machines.
### Anything as a service (XaaS)
It describes a general category of services related to cloud computing and remote access. It recognizes the vast number of products, tools and technologies that are now delivered to users as a servece over the internet.
### Public cloud
It is defined as cloud computing services offered by third-party providers over the internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them.
### Community cloud
A community cloud is a collaborative effort in which infrastructure, resources and costs are shared among several different organizations who have common concerns and service needs.
### Private cloud
Also called internal or corporate cloud, it is when an organization creates its own cloud environment that only it can utilize as an internal enterprise resource. A private cloud should be chosen when security is more important than cost.
### Hybrid cloud
A hybrid cloud combines the public and the private cloud environments.

## On-premises vs. off-premises
On-premise means the traditional approach where all your data and applications are hosted in-house. As an owner, you go ahead and maintain your servers locally within the network, buy licensed software and take care of security. You own your servers as a company.
Off-premise means using cloud providers premises and not your own.

## Fog computing
Fog computing is a horizontal, physical or virtual resource paradigm that resides between smart end-devices and traditional cloud computing or data center, providing a substancial amount of computation, storage, and communication locally and routed over the Internet.

## Containers
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## Infrastructure as code
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code. Like the principle that the same source code generates the same binary, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjuction with continuous delivery.
### Software-defined network (SDN)
Software-defined network (SDN) is an approach to IT infrastructure that abstracts networking resources into a virtualized system. SDN separates network forwarding function from network control functions with the goal of creating a network that is centrally manageable and programmable. SDN allows an IT operations team to control network traffic in complex networking topologies through a centralized panel instead of handling each network device manually.

## Serverless architecture
Serverless architecture is a cloud-native development model that allows you to build and run applications and services in a virtualized runtime container without having to manage servers. Everything in serverless is developed as a function or microservice. The underlying architecture is managed by the cloud service provider.

## Resource policies
Resource-based policies are attached to a resource. With resource-based policies, you can specify who has access to the resource and what action they can perform on it.

## Virtualization
Virtualization is the creation of a virtual resource. It can be things like computer hardware plataforms, servers, desktops, file systems, hard drives or networks.

### Virtual Machine
A virtual machine is the emulation of a computer system, providing the funcionality of physical computer. It can be a system virtual machine (providing the funcionality to run a entire operating system) or a processor virtual machine (designed to run a single computer program, like a server or web browser).

### Sprawl avoidance
Virtual machine sprawl is one of the biggest concerns facing many companies using desktop or server virtualization. The ability to quickly create virtual machines without the disciplines and controls of the physical world results in machines being provisioned unnecessarily without proper justification and approval, over-provisioned (too much CPU, memory, or disk), or consuming resources well after they no longer are required.

### VM escape protection
Virtual machine escape is the process of a program breaking out of the virtual machine on which it is running and interacting with the host operating system. A virtual machine is a "completely isolated guest operating system installation within a normal host operating system".
