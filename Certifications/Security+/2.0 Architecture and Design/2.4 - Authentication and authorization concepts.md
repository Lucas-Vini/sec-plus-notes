## Authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)

### Authentication
Authentication is the process to verify the identity of a person or something, to confirm whether someone or something is who it claims to be. The methods of authentication can be something you know (email and password), something your are (biometrics like fingerprints or retina), something you have (ID card or driver's license), something you do (the way you speak or sign your name) or somewhere you are (GPS location).

### Authorization
Authorization is the process of defining the rights, permissions or privilegies of someone to access data, locations or resources, based on who the person is. In other words, authorize is to define an access policy.

### Accounting
Accounting ensures the tracking of data, computer usage and network resources is maintained. Usually puting in a log file things like internet connections, people who tried to log on to a website or system. Log exists to keep track of all of the various things that are being done. This is important in an incident to check what happened, who did what and when. Accounting ensures non-repudiation in cases like that, because you can proof that someone did something.
