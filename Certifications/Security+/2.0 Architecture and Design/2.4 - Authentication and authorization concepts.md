## Authentication methods
### Federation
A single identity is created for a user and shared with all of the organizations in a federeation.
### Technologies
#### Time-based one-time password (TOTP)
Is a computer algorithm that generates a one-time password that uses the current time as a source of uniqueness.
#### HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP)
Is a computer algorithm that generates a one-time password that is computed from a shared secret and is synchronized between the client and the server every time it is used.

## Biometrics
Biometrics are body measurements and calculations related to human characteristics. Biometric authentication is used as a form of identification and access control.

## Multifactor authentication (MFA) factors and attributes
Multifactor authentication is the use of two or more authentication factors to prove a user's identity.
### Something you know
The users are requested to prove knowledge of a secret, such as a password, a pin or a combination to a lock.
### Something you have
The users are requested to prove possession of something that uniquily identifies them, such as a driver's license, a token device or a smart card.
### Something you are
The users are requested to prove some of his characteristics, usually biometrics methods, such as fingerprint, face or iris recognation.
### Somewhere you are
The users locations is used to ensure that you are who you claims to be.
### Something you can do
The users are requested to perform something that uniquily identifies them, such as a name signature or draw a picture.


## Authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA)

### Authentication
Authentication is the process to verify the identity of a person or something, to confirm whether someone or something is who it claims to be. The methods of authentication can be something you know (email and password), something your are (biometrics like fingerprints or retina), something you have (ID card or driver's license), something you do (the way you speak or sign your name) or somewhere you are (GPS location).

### Authorization
Authorization is the process of defining the rights, permissions or privilegies of someone to access data, locations or resources, based on who the person is. In other words, authorize is to define an access policy.

### Accounting
Accounting ensures the tracking of data, computer usage and network resources is maintained. Usually puting in a log file things like internet connections, people who tried to log on to a website or system. Log exists to keep track of all of the various things that are being done. This is important in an incident to check what happened, who did what and when. Accounting ensures non-repudiation in cases like that, because you can proof that someone did something.
