## Embedded systems
An embedded system is a computer system - a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices - that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.
### Field-Programmable Gate Array  (FPGA)
A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a costumer or a designer after manufacturing - hence the term field-programmable.

## Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)/Industrial Control System (ICS)
### Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
Supervisory control and data acquisition is a control system architecture comprising computers, networked data communications and graphical user interfaces for high-level supervision of machines and processes.
### Industrial Control System (ICS)
An industrial control system is an electronic control system and associated instrumentation used for industrial process control.

## Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects - "things" - that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophistecated industrial tools.

### Medical systems
Any medical device that runs on software using either a wireless or wired connection can be vulnerable to cyber threats that can access personal data or, in the worst case, place seriously ill patients in grave danger. One important aspect to check is to ensure that communications with the device are all encrypted. 

## Voice over IP (VoIP)
Voice over Internet Protocol, also called IP telephony, is a method and group of techniques for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol networks, such as the Internet.

## Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
It is the use of various technologies to control the temperature, humidity, and purity of the air in an enclosed space. Its goal is to provide thermal confort and acceptable indoor air quality.

## Multifunction printer (MFP)
There are a tremendous amount of risks associated with poor multi-function printer security, such as unauthorized access to printed data, unauthorized configuration changes, print job manipulation, print data disclosure, the printer as an attack point and cloud printing risks. The best practices to increase Multifunction Printer (MFP) security is change MFP default password, apply user access restrictions with passwords, encrypt hard drive, utilize secure pull printing capabilities, implement automatic data cleanup, install automatic temporary image removal, update printer software regularly and engage in third-party testing.

## Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
It is a operating system for real-time applications that processes data and events that have critically defined time constraints.

## System on Chip (SoC)
It is a integrated circuit that integrates all or most components of a computer or other electronic system.

## Communication considerations
### 5G
5G is the fifth-generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, which cellular phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones.
### Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards
A SIM card is an integrated circuit that securely stores the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number and its related key.
#### SIM cloning
SIM cloning is the process in which a legitimate SIM card is duplicated. When SIM cloning is completed, the cloned SIM card's identifying information is transferred onto a separate, secondary SIM card. The secondary card can then be used in a different phone while having all calls and associated charges attributed to the origianl SIM card.
### Zigbee
Zigbee is specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, medical device data collection, and other low-power low-bandwidth needs, designed for small scale projects which need wireless connection.

## Constraints
### Inability to patch
Embedded and specialized systems commonly have no patches or, if they have, they are too difficult to apply. So they need to have planned mitigations in case of security vulnerabilities discovered.
