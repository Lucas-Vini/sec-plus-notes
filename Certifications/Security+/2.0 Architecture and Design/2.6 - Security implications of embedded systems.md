## Communication considerations

### Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards
A SIM card is an integrated circuit that securely stores the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number and its related key.
#### SIM cloning
SIM cloning is the process in which a legitimate SIM card is duplicated. When SIM cloning is completed, the cloned SIM card's identifying information is transferred onto a separate, secondary SIM card. The secondary card can then be used in a different phone while having all calls and associated charges attributed to the origianl SIM card.
