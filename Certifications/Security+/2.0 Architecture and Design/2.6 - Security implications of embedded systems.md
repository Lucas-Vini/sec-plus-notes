### Field-Programmable Gate Array  (FPGA)
A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a costumer or a designer after manufacturing - hence the term field-programmable.

## Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
It is the use of various technologies to control the temperature, humidity, and purity of the air in an enclosed space. Its goal is to provide thermal confort and acceptable indoor air quality.

## Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards
A SIM card is an integrated circuit that securely stores the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number and its related key.
### SIM cloning
SIM cloning is the process in which a legitimate SIM card is duplicated. When SIM cloning is completed, the cloned SIM card's identifying information is transferred onto a separate, secondary SIM card. The secondary card can then be used in a different phone while having all calls and associated charges attributed to the origianl SIM card.
