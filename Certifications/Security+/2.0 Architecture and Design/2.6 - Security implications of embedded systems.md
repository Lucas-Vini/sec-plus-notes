## Embedded systems
An embedded system is a computer system - a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices - that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.
### Field-Programmable Gate Array  (FPGA)
A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a costumer or a designer after manufacturing - hence the term field-programmable.

## Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)/Industrial Control System (ICS)
### Industrial Control System (ICS)
An industrial control system is an electronic control system and associated instrumentation used for industrial process control.

## Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects - "things" - that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophistecated industrial tools.

## Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
It is the use of various technologies to control the temperature, humidity, and purity of the air in an enclosed space. Its goal is to provide thermal confort and acceptable indoor air quality.

## Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
It is a operating system for real-time applications that processes data and events that have critically defined time constraints.

## System on Chip (SoC)
It is a integrated circuit that integrates all or most components of a computer or other electronic system.

## Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards
A SIM card is an integrated circuit that securely stores the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number and its related key.
### SIM cloning
SIM cloning is the process in which a legitimate SIM card is duplicated. When SIM cloning is completed, the cloned SIM card's identifying information is transferred onto a separate, secondary SIM card. The secondary card can then be used in a different phone while having all calls and associated charges attributed to the origianl SIM card.
