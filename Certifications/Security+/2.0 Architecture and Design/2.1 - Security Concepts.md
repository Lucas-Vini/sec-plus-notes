## Configuration Management
### Baseline configuration
Baselining is the process of measuring changes in networking, hardware, software and applications. The idea is define what is normal to detect what is not normal.

## Data protection

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a type of software design to detect potential data breaches or data exfiltration transmissions and prevents them by monitoring, detecting and blocking sensitive data while in use (endpoint actions), in motion (network traffic) and at rest (data storage).

### Encryption
Encryption is the process of taking a plain text, like a text message or email, and scrambling it into a unreadable format, called cypher text. It is done using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a secret key used to decrypt the information. Ideally, only the person with the secret key can decrypt the information and read it, this ensures confidentiality.
