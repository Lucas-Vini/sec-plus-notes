## Configuration Management
Configuration management is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It’s a way to make sure that a system performs as it’s expected to as changes are made over time.
### Diagrams
Part of the documentation you’ll create will be the network diagram. It’s important to know what devices are connected to other devices. And it’s also important to know where these devices may be physically located in the network. This might involve a map that shows what devices are connected to each other.
### Baseline configuration
Baselining is the process of measuring changes in networking, hardware, software and applications. The idea is define what is normal to detect what is not normal.
### Standard naming conventions
All rule and rule set definitions, all executable data rules and rule sets, all metrics, and all global variables require a name. A name can either facilitate or hinder reuse and sharing of these components, so while names can be freeform and be quickly created when simply evaluating and testing conditions, it is critical to identify an effective naming standard for ongoing quality monitoring.
### Internet protocol (IP) schema
TCP/IP includes an Internet addressing scheme that allows users and applications to identify a specific network or host with which to communicate. An Internet address works like a postal address, allowing data to be routed to the chosen destination. TCP/IP provides standards for assigning addresses to networks, subnetworks, hosts, and sockets, and for using special addresses for broadcasts and local loopback.

## Data sovereignty
Data sovereignty isn’t a law or set of regulations itself, but the idea that data is subject to the laws and governance structures from where it’s collected. In other words, a business based in the United States will still have to comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and any other local data laws, if customer data was collected from, say, Italy. Likewise, if they collected data from a customer located in California, the same company also has to comply with California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

## Data protection
### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a type of software design to detect potential data breaches or data exfiltration transmissions and prevents them by monitoring, detecting and blocking sensitive data while in use (endpoint actions), in motion (network traffic) and at rest (data storage).
### Masking
Data masking is a way to create a fake, but a realistic version of your organizational data. The goal is to protect sensitive data, while providing a functional alternative when real data is not needed - for example, in user training, sales demos, or software testing.
### Encryption
Encryption is the process of taking a plain text, like a text message or email, and scrambling it into a unreadable format, called cypher text. It is done using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a secret key used to decrypt the information. Ideally, only the person with the secret key can decrypt the information and read it, this ensures confidentiality.
### At rest
Data at rest means data that is housed physically on computer data storage in any digital form. Data at rest includes both structured and unstructured data.
### In transit/motion
Data in transit is any data that is sent from one system to another. This includes communication between resources within your workload as well as communication between other services and your end users.
### In processing
Also known as data in use, it is an term referring to active data which is stored in a non-persistent digital state typically in computer random access memory (RAM), CPU caches or CPU registers.
### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of turning a meaningful piece of data, such as an account number, into a random string of characters called a token that has no meaningful value if breached. Tokens serve as reference to the original data, but cannot be used to guess those values. That’s because, unlike encryption, tokenization does not use a mathematical process to transform the sensitive information into the token. There is no key, or algorithm, that can be used to derive the original data for a token. Instead, tokenization uses a database, called a token vault, which stores the relationship between the sensitive value and the token. The real data in the vault is then secured, often via encryption.
### Rights management
Rights management is a term for control systems that allow a rights owner to exert control over information immediately. It enables publishers of information to control what recipients can do with it in order to prevent intellectual property theft and stop unauthorized sharing/ piracy.

## Geographical considerations
Having an operational presence in some countries will undoubtedly affect your organisation’s cyber threat profile. However, it is important to recognise that frequently, cyber threats do not manifest in the same way as other operational risks that are much more specific to a single geography. Viewing cyber security purely through the same geographic lens as that used for monitoring other operational risks does not allow for a nuance in tracking threat actors that are not motivated by geography but by myriad other - often complex – factors.

## Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection
TLS inspection is used to detect and prevent advanced threats over encrypted TLS channels. TLS inspection transparently decrypts encrypted traffic and makes it available for advanced security features such as IDS/IPS, malware prevention, and URL filtering. This provides visibility into the encrypted traffic without offloading and while retaining end-to-end encryption.

## Hashing
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.

### Application Programming Interface (API) considerations
API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In contrast to a user interface, which connects a software to a person, an application programming interface connects a software to another software. It enables software developers to access functions of another application, making possible to integrate different softwares.


## Site resiliency
It consists of having offices/resources in different locations in case of disaster or unavailability of one of the sites.
### Hot site
A near duplicate of the original site of the organization that can be up and running within minutes.
### Cold site
A site that just has tables, chairs, bathrooms and possibly some technical items like phones and network cabling, but has no configured computers and servers and it can take some days to re-establish normality.
### Warm site
A site that has computers, phones and servers, but they might require some configuration before user can start working.

## Deception and disruption
### Honeypots
Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site and contains informations or resources of value to attackers. It is actually isolated, monitored and capable of blocking or analyzing the attackers.
### Honeynets
A honeynet is a decoy network that contains one or more honeypots. It looks like a real network and contains multiple systems but is hosted on one or only a few servers, each representing one environment.
### Fake telemetry
Attackers can use fake telemetry to confuse machine learning algorithms or intrusion detection.
### DNS sinkhole
A DNS sinkhole is a method of redirecting traffic from one DNS server to another. It can be used for security purposes, such as malware detection or for research purposes. By using a DNS sinkhole, you can direct all traffic for a given domain name to a specific server (it can be a non-existent server through the null interface, to stop DDoS attacks), which can be monitored for malicious activity.
