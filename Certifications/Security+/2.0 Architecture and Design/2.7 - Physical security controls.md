## Protected cable distribution
Secured system of cables management to ensure that the wired network remains free from eavesdropping, data emanations, eletromagnetic field interferations, wire tapping and other threats.

## Secure data destruction
### Burning
Is the last and less commonly used physical destruction method of disposing data. The advantage of this method is that it removes all the data thus providing absolute security of data.
### Shredding
Is the process of data destruction by shredding, destroying the drivers platters, mechanisms and electronic components rendering the data virtually unrecoverable.
### Pulping
It only applies to data on paper. Is the process of turning paper into a liquid slurry.
### Degaussing
Is the process of eliminating unwanted data stored in disk media by exposing the hard drive to a powerful magnetic field.
