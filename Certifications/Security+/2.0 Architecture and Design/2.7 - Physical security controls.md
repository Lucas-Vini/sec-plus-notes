## Badges
A proximity card or prox card also known as a key card or keycard is a contactless smart card which can be read without inserting it into a reader device, as required by earlier magnetic stripe cards such as credit cards and contact type smart cards.
## Alarms
A device or function that signals the existence of an abnormal condition by making an audible or visible discrete change, or both, so as to attract attention to that condition.
## Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)
Also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors.
## Locks
It is a mechanical or electronic fastening device that is released by a physical object (suck as key, keycard, fingerprint, RFID card, security token or coin), by supplying secret information (such as a number or letter permutation or password).
### Biometrics
It uses human characteristics to unlock, such as fingerprint, retine scan or facial recognation.
### Electronic
It can use things like a RFID card or a pin to unlock.
### Physical
It usually use a key to unlock.
### cable locks
It is a cable that is unlocked by a key or a pin.

## Fencing
Security fencing is a type of fencing used mostly on industrial or commercial property with the purpose of providing enhanced protection for the assets, for the storage areas as well as the open areas on the property.

## Fire suppression
Fire suppression systems are used to extinguish, control, or in some cases, entirely prevent fires from spreading or occurring.
## Sensors
### Temperature
A temperature sensor is an electronic device that measures the temperature of its environment and converts the input data into electronic data to record, monitor, or signal temperature changes.
## Faraday cage
A Faraday cage or Faraday shield is an enclosure used to block electromagnetic fields. A Faraday cage may be formed by a continuous covering of conductive material, or by a mesh of such materials.

## Screened subnet (previously known as demilitarized zone)
A perimeter network or screened subnet separating an internal network that is more trusted from an external network that is less trusted.

## Protected cable distribution
Secured system of cables management to ensure that the wired network remains free from eavesdropping, data emanations, eletromagnetic field interferations, wire tapping and other threats.

## Secure areas
### Hot aisle
In hot aisle containment, the servers are positioned not with their backs to the outside of the enclosure, but back-to-back. This setup creates an aisle between the servers where heat can escape.
### Cold aisle
Cold aisles work by efficiently directing cold air to the front of the servers, where it is pulled through the servers into a warm aisle or a space near a warm air return to be re-cooled.

## Secure data destruction
### Burning
Is the last and less commonly used physical destruction method of disposing data. The advantage of this method is that it removes all the data thus providing absolute security of data.
### Shredding
Is the process of data destruction by shredding, destroying the drivers platters, mechanisms and electronic components rendering the data virtually unrecoverable.
### Pulping
It only applies to data on paper. Is the process of turning paper into a liquid slurry.
### Pulverizing
Solid State Drives (SSDs) need pulverization as fine as 2 mm to ensure 100% data eradication because they store vast amount of data on small flash memory chips, resulting only dust.
### Degaussing
Is the process of eliminating unwanted data stored in disk media by exposing the hard drive to a powerful magnetic field.
