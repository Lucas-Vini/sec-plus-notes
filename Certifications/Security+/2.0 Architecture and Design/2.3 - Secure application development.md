## Secure coding techniques
### Use of third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs)
The use of thrd-party libraries must come from trusted sources to ensure that no malicious code is being added. Furthermore, even to trusted third-party libraries it must be always verified if the version used has no known vulnerabilities and if it still supported.

## Version Control
It is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programas, documents, large web sites or other collection of information. Version control is a component of software configuration management. Semantic versioning of a software can be represented by numbers in the Major.Minor.Patch format. Patch version makes backwards compatible bug fixes. Minor version add functionality in a backwards compatible manner. Major version makes imcompatible changes.
