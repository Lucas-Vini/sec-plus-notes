## Redundancy
It means having two or more ways to provide the same thing. Redundancy helps ensure fault-tolerance to continue operations.
### Disk
#### Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) levels
RAID is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units for the purpose of data redundancy, performance improvement or both.
##### RAID 0
Consists of stripping data across multiple disk to increase read and write performance. Because stripping distributes the contents of each file among all drives in the set, the failure of any drive causes the entire RAID 0 volume and all files to be lost.
##### RAID 1
Consists of data mirroring. Data is written identically to two or more drives. It provides redundancy and fault-tolerance, the array continues to operate as long as at least one drive is functioning.
##### RAID 10
Consists of a striped RAID of two mirrored RAIDs (combines RAID 1 and RAID 0).

### Power
An enclosure that provides two or more complete power supplies.
#### Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
Combines the funcionality of a surge protector with that of a battery backup.
#### Generator
An emergency power system used when there is outage of the regular electric grid power.

## Backup Types
### Network Attached Storage (NAS)
Network Attached Storage (NAS) is a file-level storage architecture that makes stored data more accessible to networked devices. NAS gives networks a single access point for storage.

### Storage Area Network (SAN)
Storage Area Network is a network designed to provide access to block-level data storage. It may consist of NAS devices.
