## Digital Signatures
Digital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography. In many instances, they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through a non-secure channel. They provide non-repudiation, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret.
## Key length
Key size, key length or key space refer to the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm. Key length defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security, since the security of all algorithms can be violated by brute-force attacks.
## Key stretching
Key stretching techniques are used to make a possibly weak key, tipically a password or passphrase, more secure against a brute force attack by increasing the resources (time and possibly space) it takes to test each possible key. Examples of key stretching algorithms are bcrypt, scrypt and PBKDF2.
## Salting
A salt is a random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Historically, only a cryptographic hash function of the password was stored on a system, but over time, additional safeguards were developed to protect against duplicate or common passwords being identifiable (as their hashes are identical).
## Hashing
A method of calculating a relatively unique output (called a hash digest) for an input of nearly any size (a file, text, image, etc.) by applying a cryptographic hash function to the input data. 
## Key exchange
Key exchange is a method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received. If the cipher is is a symmetric key cipher, both will nedd a copy of the same key. If it is an asymmetric key cipher, with the public/private key property, both will need the other's public key.
### Elliptic-Curve Cryptography
ECC is the next generation of public key cryptography and, based on currently understood mathematics, provides a significatly more secure foundation than first generation public key cryptography systems like RSA. If you're worried about ensuring the highest level of security while maintaining performance, ECC makes senso to adopt. ECC uses fewer number of bits, but offers the same level of cryptography strength, so it is considered more suitable for mobile devices.
## Perfect Foward Secrecy (PFS)
An option that causes a new secret key to be created and shared through a new Diffie-Hellman key exchange for each session established with the server. This provides protection against the use of compromised old keys that could be used to attack the newer derived keys still in use for integrity and confidentiality protection.
## Quantum
### Communication
In the realm of quantum communication, one wants to send qubits from one quantum processor to another over long distances. This way, local quantum networks can be intra connected into a quantum internet.
### Computing
Quantum computing is a type of computation whose operations can harness phenomena of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference and entanglement. Devices that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers.

## Post-quantum
The goal of post-quantum cryptography is to develop cryptographic systems thar are secure against both quantum and classical computers and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.

## Ephemeral
A cryptographic key that is generated for each execution of a key-establishment process and that meets other requirements of the key type.

## Blockchain
A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. Blockchains are tipically managed by peer-to-peer network for use as publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks.
### Public ledgers
A public ledger derives its name from the age-old record-keeping system used to record information such as agricultural commodity prices, news and analysis. The public ledger was available for general public viewing as well as for verification. A cryptocurrency public ledger is a record-keeping system that maintains participants' identities anonymously, their respective cryptocurrency balances and a record of all the genuine transactions executed between network participants.

## Cipher suites
### Stream
A stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream. In a stream cipher, each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the ciphertext stream.
### Block
A block cipher is a determinisc algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks. They are specified elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols and are widely used to encrypt large amounts of data, including in data exchange protocols. 

## Symmetric vs. asymmetric
Symmetric encryption involves the use of one key for both encryption and decryption. Some examples of symmetric algorithms are DES, 3DES, IDEA, AES, Blowfish, Twofish, RC4, RC5 and RC6. Asymmetric encryption works with a pair of keys. The beginning of asymmetric encryption involves the creation of a pair of keys, one of which is a public key and the other which is a private key. The public key is accessible by anyone, while the private key must be kept a secret from everyone but the creator of the key. This is because encryption occurs with the public key, while decryption occurs with the private key. The recipient of the data will provide the sender with the public key, which will be used to encrypt the data. Some examples of asymmetric algorithms are Diffie-Hellman, RSA and ECC.

## Steganography
Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image or video is concealed within another file, message, image or video.

## Homomorphic
Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that permits user to perform computations on its encrypted data without first decrypting it. 

## Common use cases
### Low latency
Symmetric encryption is faster than asymmetric encryption. Asymetric encryption sacrifies speed for security, while symmetric encryption sacrifies security for speed.
### Supporting confidentiality
The sender encrypts the message using a cryptographic key, and the recipient decrypts the message using a cryptographic key (if using a symmetric algorithm, the same key used to encrypt, if using an asymmetric algorithm, the private key associated with the public key used to encrypt the message).
### Supporting non-repudiation
With asymmetric encryption we're able to use our private key to encrypt messages and people can use our public key to be able to prove that this is really what we sent to them. And this allows us also validate signatures from other people.
